## Reddit API

Reddit API mostly lacks public documentation, and anything is subject to change without warning. Be wary, and don't spend time making stuff that's gonna break tomorrow prettier than necessary.

The request and response types are missing plenty of properties, for the same reason. Requests and responses might change without warning, so my recommendation is to only type the required fields.
