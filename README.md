# Reddit Gallery Client

A small web app for browsing [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com) images in a stylized grid. The app has [its own API](https://github.com/pritoranta/reddit-gallery-api), but is dependent on Reddit API for proper functionality. Creating a custom API was necessary (instead of calling Reddit API directly), because many browsers block cross-origin requests to Reddit, often rendering the site unusable.

Inspired by the image grid of [Cara](https://cara.app/)!
