# Reddit Gallery Client

A small web app for browsing [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com) images in a stylized grid. The app is purely client-side, and dependent on Reddit API for proper functionality. Certain browser settings can render the site unusable, if they disable fetching of content from a third-party website. Reddit API also often hates VPNs.

Inspired by the image grid of [Cara](https://cara.app/)!
